# A Chess Engine

This is my simple learning project written in python from scratch.

The project focuses on implementing a valid chess engine
that follows all the classical rules of chess.
The logic behind all moves validations is based on how an oridinary player would validate them.
Although it is not the proper way to build a chess engine,
that's the easiest and fastest way I came up with in a short period of time.

At this point the engine is not fully functional. I have to implement checkmates,
draws, stalemates, and castling. Although just castling will be enough to be able to play
a casual game of chess, since all the other legal moves are already implemented 
and making illegal moves is already impossible.

Also I plan to implement some other variations of chess (Fischer chess, tic tac chess, and no draw chess) that a user
would be able to play changing the game mode in the tool bar.
For now the tool panel contains only one functional button - restart.

After implementing all the above I try to add a "Go" (game) engine to the project to transorm it into
a multiple board games project.
