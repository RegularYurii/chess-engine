# A Chess Engine

This is my simple unfinished project written in python.
The project focuses on implementing a valid chess engine
that follows all the classical rules of chess.

At this point the engine is not fully functional, I have to implement checkmates,
draws, stalemates, and castling. Although it will be enough to play a casual game of chess,
I will have focus on cleaning up all the hardcoding that's left and improving the structure.

Also I plan to implement some other variations of chess (Fischer chess, tic tac chess, and no draw chess) that a user
would be able to play changing the game mode in the tool bar.
For now the tool panel contains only one functional button - restart.

After implementing all the above I might add a "Go" (game) engine to the project to transorm it into
a multiple board games project.
